Lazspel by Raf20076, Poland, 2020

Lazspell is an example of a speller which checks spelling in German, English, Spanish,
French, Italian, Portugues, Polish and Russian.

All dictionaries are coded in UTF-8 from https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries

Lazspell uses hunspell.pas and hunspell.inc from https://github.com/davidbannon/hunspell4pas
To call Application in hunspell.pas add Forms to uses in implementation. It should 
in hunspell.pas look like

uses LazUTF8, SysUtils, {$ifdef linux}Process,{$endif} LazFileUtils, {Forms,} lazlogger, Forms;
// LazUTF8 requires lazutils be added to dependencies
// Forms needed so we can call Application.~   , add LCLBase to dependencies
// lazlogger for the debug lines.
